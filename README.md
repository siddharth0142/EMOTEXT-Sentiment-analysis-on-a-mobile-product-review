# EMOTEXT-Sentiment-Analysis-Of-Online-Mobile-Product-Review


The main goal is to examine consumer sentiments as they are presented in mobile product reviews that were obtained from Flipkart utilising web scraping methods and BeautifulSoup. To ensure accuracy and relevance, the collected reviews underwent a comprehensive data preprocessing procedure. Recognizing the impact of emoticons on sentiment expression, we also converted the reviews into text without emojis and text with emojis.
We performed data labelling to facilitate sentiment analysis by assigning each review to a sentiment class, such as positive or negative, depending on the total sentiment expressed. To encode the textual data as numerical vectors for subsequent analysis, we used a variety of feature vectorization algorithms, including Glove, FastText, and Word2Vec. These methods enable the semantic meaning and contextual links between words and phrases in the reviews to be captured, increasing the precision of the sentiment analysis model.AdaBoost and XGBoost, two well-known ensemble learning methods, were used to create and train the sentiment analysis model. Multiple models are combined in ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy and generalization to new data. Our sentiment analysis model successfully and accurately identified positive and negative mobile product evaluations using these potent techniques.
